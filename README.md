##Vision Quest

ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
Many existing educational or assessment tools for children with learning challenges, visual tracking difficulties, or attention-related issues are either too clinical or unengaging. There's a gap in accessible, gamified tools that can evaluate visual cognition while also being fun and approachable for young users.

ðŸ’¡ Solution
Vision Quest is an interactive mobile app designed to assess and enhance children's visual attention, color recognition, and letter identification skills through engaging mini-games. Built with React Native + Expo Router, it provides a seamless experience while tracking user performance across two main tests:

ðŸŸ¦ Color Quest â€“ Tests the childâ€™s ability to recognize and react to different colors in a timed challenge.

ðŸ”¤ Letter Hunt â€“ Challenges the user to find specific letters hidden among distractions.

At the end of both tests, results are presented visually using a bar graph, giving both kids and parents/educators a clear idea of performance in each category.

Key Features
ðŸŽ® Game-like interface to keep kids engaged while testing cognitive skills.
ðŸ“Š Results Visualization via bar graphs for easy interpretation of test scores.

ðŸ“ˆ Future Improvements
- Add real-time AI-based eye tracking for more detailed interaction metrics.
- Store progress using local storage or backend integration.
- Add more mini-games targeting different cognitive skills (e.g., memory, sequencing).

Overall, this project is inspired by the need for more accessible, gamified cognitive assessment tools for kids â€“ especially those who may find traditional testing environments intimidating or boring.
