## The Problem
Many existing educational or assessment tools for children with learning challenges, visual tracking difficulties, or attention-related issues are either too clinical or unengaging. There's a gap in accessible, gamified tools that can evaluate visual cognition while also being fun and approachable for young users.

## Our Solution 
Vision Quest is an interactive mobile app designed to assess and enhance children's visual attention, color recognition, and letter identification skills through engaging mini-games. Built with React Native + Expo Router, it provides a seamless experience while tracking user performance across two main tests:

1. Color Quest – Tests the child’s ability to recognize and react to different colors in a timed challenge.

2. Letter Hunt – Challenges the user to find specific letters hidden among distractions.

At the end of both tests, results are presented visually using a bar graph, giving both kids and parents/educators a clear idea of performance in each category.

# Key Features 
- Game-like interface to keep kids engaged while testing cognitive skills
- Results Visualization via bar graphs for easy interpretation of test scores

## Future Improvements
- Add real-time AI-based eye tracking for more detailed interaction metrics
- Store progress using local storage or backend integration
- Add more mini-games targeting different cognitive skills (e.g., memory, sequencing)
  
Overall, this project is inspired by the need for more accessible, gamified cognitive assessment tools for kids – especially those who may find traditional testing environments intimidating or boring. add that to this
